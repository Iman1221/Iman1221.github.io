see my [face recognition using webcam project in GitHub](https://https://github.com/Iman1221/Face-gender-race-recognition-with-webcam) for training and testing a face recogniton system.

In this tutorial, we’ll see how to create and launch a face recognition algorithm in Python. We’ll also train a model for face recognition using SVM classifier and Arcface loss.

### Fcae recognition
Assume you have some image of known people, and you want to identify these people.
If you want to create a roubust face recognition system, you need to collect as many face images of each person as you can. 
For example, assume you want to identify 5 people as in bellow:
