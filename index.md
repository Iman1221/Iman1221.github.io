## Fcae recognition

In this tutorial, we’ll see how to create and launch a face recognition algorithm in Python. We’ll also train a model for face recognition using SVM classifier and Arcface loss.

Assume you have some image of known people.

see my [face recognition using webcam project in GitHub](https://https://github.com/Iman1221/Face-gender-race-recognition-with-webcam) for training and testing a face recogniton system.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Iman1221/Iman1221.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
